# Introduction

* Connecting customers with the food is the main purpose of this project. Our website helps to order the
  food of individual choice that are present in the menu that is provided by the user. It shows us the price of the
  food with their choice of cuisine.

# Anticipated Technologies

* In order to develop the application, we are planning to use JAVA for the backend.
* HTML and CSS for the front end along with Bootstrap and Java script for validation.
* For the Database and to store the data we are using the oracle SQL with SQL Workbench tool.

# Method/Approach

> To develop this web-based application we need to create a relational database schema to work on the database. And need to
  make the controller and API call to return methods to send the output. need to write the html and CSS scripts to complete 
  the frontend part with responsive webpages. And test with other scenarios of password validation and user accessibility.
  the responsive webpages need to make and check the application feasibility.

# Estimated Timeline
> The project has various key points and milestones to complete the project.
  * Databases need to be designed and test the data and entity relationship of application.
  * The backend code takes much time to fulfill all possible ideas to create implementation classes.
  * Need to make the frontend webpages with HTML and CSS with good responsive way it will take some time to test the application.

  * The project will complete by the 1st week of December with all possible way tested scenarios.

# Anticipated Problems

> As of now we couldn't see any problemâ€™s in our project we might get in the implementation time.
